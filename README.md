You can get Kalzit [here](https://www.github.com/triploit/Kalzit).
In future versions, there will be a feature which allows you to install apps from the internet. Once that feature is available, you can install this app with the following command:

```
kalzit install app https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NetLamp-Y/KalzitTestApp/master
```
